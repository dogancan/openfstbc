These bash completions will add tab completion to OpenFst flags. This file adds three types of completions based on the flagâ€™s value type.

* Flags which accept a path or a numeric value will complete with a trailing `=` character and then default to the standard path completion.

* Binary flags will complete without a trailing `=` character.

* Flags which accept an enumerable string value will complete with a trailing `=` and then suggest suitable values. For example `--arc_type=` completions will suggest `log` and `standard`.
